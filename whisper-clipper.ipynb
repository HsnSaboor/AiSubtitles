        "\n",
        "[faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper) is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Notebook will guide you through the transcription or translation of a  video file (from Youtube/Google Drive) using Faster Whisper. You'll be able to explore most inference parameters or use the Notebook as-is to store the output and video audio in your Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **How to use**\n",
        "1. Read and understand the notebook. You should at the very least modify the **video selection section** to choose the video you wish to translate/transcribe\n",
        "2. Click Runtime -> Run all and wait for the notebook to do its magic, alternatively you may run the cells one by one and skip the Google Drive portion if you do not intend to use it\n",
        "3. A download prompt should appear once subtitles is ready, or check the 'Files' tab on the left for the output\n"
